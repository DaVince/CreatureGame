- Implement mouse
- Implement mouse interaction with map (adding/removing walls)

- Make scaling mechanism more global so that both the map can zoom out and the creature zoom accordingly

- Add methods to slowly deteriorate walls
- Connect deterioration mechanism to collision code (provided by Rhuan)
